"project_dummy.xlsx" stores dummy patient data (N = 1000)
"dummy1.xlsx" stores first half of dummy patient data (N = 500). Proxy for initial user data before using Portal.
"dummy2.xlsx" stores second half of dummy patient data (N = 500). Proxy for post-use user data.

"scraping.ipynb" stores initial scraping work
"p-values.ipynb" scrapes "dummy1.xlsx" and "dummy2.xlsx", then reports p-values for all survey items. As of now, we do not split based on demographic data (e.g. "Veteran vs. Caregiver", "Sex", "Age", "Chronic Conditions" etc.)

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* "project_dummy.xlsx" stores dummy patient data (N = 1000)
* "dummy1.xlsx" stores first half of dummy patient data (N = 500). Proxy for initial user data before using Portal.
* "dummy2.xlsx" stores second half of dummy patient data (N = 500). Proxy for post-use user data.
